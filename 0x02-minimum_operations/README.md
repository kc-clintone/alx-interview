## Introduction
This document provides explanation of the `minOperations` function, which calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` H characters in a text file, starting from a single character 'H' and using only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste".

## Problem Statement
Given a number `n`, write a method `minOperations(n)` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` H characters in the file. If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`.

### Example:
```python
n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
```

## Approach
The problem can be approached by understanding the prime factorization of the number `n`. The minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly `n` H characters can be found by summing the prime factors of `n`.

### Steps:
1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - Break down the number `n` into its prime factors.
   - The sum of these prime factors gives the minimum number of operations needed.

### Explanation of Operations:
- Each "Copy All" followed by a series of "Paste" operations can be thought of as multiplying the current number of H's by a certain factor.
- For example, starting with 1 H, if we "Copy All" and then "Paste" it 3 times, we effectively have 4 H's (1 initial + 3 pastes).

## Implementation
The following Python function implements the described approach:

```python
def minOperations(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    
    operations = 0
    factor = 2
    
    while n > 1:
        while n % factor == 0:
            operations += factor
            n //= factor
        factor += 1
    
    return operations
```

## Usage
To use the `minOperations` function, simply call it with the desired number `n`:

```python
result = minOperations(9)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

## Examples
### Example 1:
```python
n = 9

# Operations: 6
# Explanation:
# H (1 operation)
# Copy All, Paste => HH (2 operations)
# Paste => HHH (3 operations)
# Copy All, Paste => HHHHHH (5 operations)
# Paste => HHHHHHHHH (6 operations)

result = minOperations(9)
print(result)  # Output: 6
```

### Example 2:
```python
n = 15

# Operations: 8
# Explanation:
# H (1 operation)
# Copy All, Paste => HH (2 operations)
# Paste => HHH (3 operations)
# Copy All, Paste => HHHHHHH (7 operations)
# Paste => HHHHHHHHHHHHHHH (8 operations)

result = minOperations(15)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

## Edge Cases
- If `n` is `1`, the function should return `0` since no operations are needed.
- If `n` is a prime number, the function should correctly handle it by treating `n` itself as the final factor.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The function runs in O(√n) time because it checks for factors up to √n.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## Conclusion
The `minOperations` function effectively calculates the minimum number of operations needed to get exactly `n` H characters in a file. By leveraging the properties of prime factorization, it provides an efficient solution to the problem.
